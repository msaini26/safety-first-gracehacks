# safety-first-gracehacks

## Inspiration
After getting numerous CruzAlerts (Safety Alert System organized by the University of California, Santa Cruz) about incidents on campus that have made students and faculty feel unsafe, we decided to create a webpage to provide resources to stay safe and empowered. 

## What it does
Our webpage has a built-in map with pinpoints on the UCSC campus that are well-lit to help guide students and staff that are walking back late at night. It also has an empowerment section where individuals can feel empowered through power yoga poses designed to improve confidence over time. 

## How we built it
We built the structure of our webpage using HTML, design using CSS, and functionality using Javascript. We used the Google Map API to build the safety spots on campus and we used TensorFlow.js to create the empowerment machine learning feature that takes visual user input to detect poses. 

## Challenges we ran into


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting the map and the empowerment feature successfully embedded in our webpage was difficult yet rewarding. Though changing small details with the design and the fit of images was tedious, we accomplished most of the goals we set for ourselves. 

## What we learned


## What's next for Safety First
We want to include a discussion forum on our webpage to encourage further community building and discussion amongst UCSC student and staff. Providing additional safety havens across campus is also a goal so having a section on the webpage where students can talk about their experiences would help students feel less isolated.
